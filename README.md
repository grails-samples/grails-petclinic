Petclinic Sample Application
============================

This is the standard introductory sample application for Grails. To get started with it, simply clone the repository and then from within your local copy run:

    ./gradlew run

on Unix-like systems, or

    gradlew run

on Windows via the command prompt. Once the server has started up, you can copy the URL and paste it in a browser.

Follow the tutorial link to learn about Grails or click on the View Source for Controller/View links to see the underlying code for whatever page you are currently on.
